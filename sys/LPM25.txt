HARDWARE INFO:
    Name: LPM25 (Low Power Monitor model 25)
    Hardware ID: 0x1F25
    Manufacturer: 0x911F (ASTB_USS)

DESCRIPTION:
    LPM25 is a 320x200 pixel color display
    compatible with V16 hardware. The display
    is split into 4x8 pixel cells which
    displays a colored character making a
    80x25 grid of characters.
    LPM25 has no internal video memory: instead
    it uses the internal V16 memory in read-only mode.
    The display reads from the memory at constant rate
    of 50 times per second (50 Hz).
    
    LPM25 reads text data from memory at TEXT_OFF address.
    Each text cell consists of three parts:
        Bits 0..3:  background color
        Bits 4..7:  foreground color
        Bits 8..15: extended ASCII character code.

    The glyps for characters are also read from memory at
    CHAR_OFF address. Each glyph is a 32-bit big-endian value
    divided by eight quartets representing a row in the glyph:
    The default 'A' character: 0x04AAEAAA

IO PORTS:
    LPM25 connects its data registers to V16
    IO ports in read-write mode. These ports include:
        0x1F01: TEXT_OFF
            The register's value is an offset in V16 memory
            to an area where the text data begins.
        0x1F02: CHAR_OFF
            The register's value is an offset in V16 memory
            to an area where the charset data begins.
