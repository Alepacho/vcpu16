This is the VCPU-16 assembler.

Generic command line usage:
    vcpu-as [options] filename
    options:
        -o <filename>   -- specify the output filename
        -h              -- print a help message and exit
        -v              -- print version and exit
    filename            -- input source file

VCPU-16 assembler uses AT&T syntax meaning that
any operand must have a valid prefix and any instruction
needs to be as verbose as possible.

Assembler feature checklist:
[X] Parsing mnemonics, registers and literal values
[X] Generating a valid VCPU bytecode
[X] Label support
[X] Directive support

Code example.
The following code tests the features
of the assembler and of the runtime.

        mov $0x8000, %R0        # Video buffer
        mov $0x0800, %R1        # Base character
        loop:
            ige $0x0FFF, %R1    # If exceeds maximum character
            mov $end, %PC       # then finished
            mwr %R1, %R0        # Write memory[R0]
            inc %R0             # R0++
            inc %R1             # R1++
            mov $loop, %PC      # loop back
        end:
            mov $end, %PC       # loop indefinitely

There's a lot of things left for me to do
but in general the assembler is pretty much
finished and can be used to write programs.
